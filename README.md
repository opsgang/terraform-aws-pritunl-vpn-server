# Overview
This module setups a VPN server for a VPC to connect to instances.

*Before you start to use the module you have to make sure you've created resources below*

* healthchecks.io account and cron entry for monitoring the backup script

After provisioning, don't forget to run commands below:

* **Pritunl setup**
  * `sudo pritunl setup-key`

# Input variables

* **aws_key_name:** SSH Key pair for VPN instance
* **vpc_id:** The VPC id
* **public_subnet_id:** One of the public subnets to create the instance
* **ami_id:** Amazon Linux AMI ID
* **instance_type:** Instance type of the VPN box (t2.small is mostly enough)
* **whitelist:** List of office IP addresses that you can SSH and non-VPN connected users can reach temporary profile download pages
* **tags:** Map of AWS Tag key and values
* **resource_name_prefix:** All the resources will be prefixed with the value of this variable
* **healthchecks_io_key:** Health check key for healthchecks.io

# Outputs
* **vpn_instance_private_ip_address:** Private IP address of the instance
* **vpn_public_ip_addres:** EIP of the VPN box
* **vpn_management_ui:** URL for the management UI


# Usage

```
provider "aws" {
  region  = "eu-west-2"
}

module "app_pritunl" {
  source = "github.com/opsgang/terraform_pritunl?ref=2.0.0"

  aws_key_name         = "org-eu-west-2"
  vpc_id               = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  public_subnet_id     = "${module.vpc.public_subnets[1]}"
  ami_id               = "ami-403e2524"
  instance_type        = "t2.nano"
  resource_name_prefix = "opsgang-pritunl"
  healthchecks_io_key  = "NNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNN"

  whitelist = [
    "8.8.8.8/32",
  ]

  tags {
    "role" = "vpn"
    "env"  = "prod"
  }
}
```

**P.S. :** Yes, AMI id is hardcoded! This module meant to be used in your VPC template. Presumably, no one wants to destroy the VPN instance and restore the configuration after `terraform apply` against to VPC. There is no harm to manage that manually and keep people working during the day.

*There will be wiki link about initial setup of Pritunl*
